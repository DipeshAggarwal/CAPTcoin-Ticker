CAPTcoin-Ticker
===============

Another Implementation of Ticker.js.

Notable things:
  > * Doesn't use any external libraries.
  > * Dropdown list is managed internally now so it's easier for the API developer to add or remove language. [Just change currList]
  > * Decreases the amount of stuff the user has to include in their page.

To-Do
  > * Add compatability for old IE browsers
